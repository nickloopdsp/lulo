🗺️ Lulo Product Roadmap
Purpose: To guide development across phases — focused on a wishlist-first, socially powered, cross-border shopping experience.

🔹 Core Build (MVP)
1. Wishlist System

Add items manually or via pasted link

Upload image to find matching product (Google Lens-style)

Toggle visibility: private / public / “friends only”

Mark as “gift me” (light feature, optional toggle)

Add notes (e.g. sizing, urgency, occasion)

Track prices across platforms

2. Browser Extension (Safari/Chrome)

Save items to Lulo wishlist from any e-commerce site

Auto-detect product name, price, and image

Seamless sync with app wishlist

3. Closet System

Digitize wardrobe with images and tags

Add notes (e.g. size, brand, fit info)

Toggle item as “borrowable” or not

Filter by color, type, frequency of wear

4. Lookboard Creator

Combine wishlist + closet items into collage layouts

Option to build manually (drag-and-drop) or AI-generated layouts

Use cases: event styling, trip packing, bachelorette planning

Collages can be shared privately or publicly with friends

5. Network & Social Layer

Add friends, create small fashion circles

Share wishlists, items, lookboards

Open-ended needs list (e.g. “I’m looking for PJs”)

Friends can recommend items and get Lulo points (gamified reward system)

6. Style Icons Section

Follow public profiles of influencers or fashion personalities

Bookmark specific pieces they’ve worn (“Get the Look”)

See which items are most saved across the community

7. News Feed

Aggregated editorial content from sources like Vogue, Who What Wear, etc.

AI-curated to match wishlist interests or wardrobe gaps

Sponsored trend posts and integrated branded content opportunities

8. Search & Discovery

Browse trending items across the community

Filter by category, popularity, country, or friends’ favorites

9. Profile

Manage privacy and visibility

Track activity, points, borrowing status

Connect retail accounts (for optional import of purchase history)

🟡 Phase 2 — Social + Cross-Border Expansion
10. Global Shopping Utility: “Suitcase Fairy”

Request hard-to-find or unavailable products from international friends

Notify users when friends are traveling between key cities

Track who might be able to carry items (e.g. “Ana is going to Paris next week”)

Encourage organic exchange rather than a logistics service

11. AI Fit Assistant

Sizing recommendation engine based on known closet items + brand fit history

Helps reduce guesswork on international sizing and returns

12. Points & Badges System

Reward for helpful recs, bringing back products, lending clothes

Points could unlock styling perks or elevated visibility

🔮 Future Expansion Plans
13. Beauty & Wellness Companion App: Fresa

Your Vanity Case = products you own

In Your Radar = wishlist-style save area

Upload selfies of what a product looked like on you

AI ingredient analysis for transparency and clean beauty alternatives

Suitcase Fairy-style feature for global beauty product access

Social review tool: “Have You Tried This?” section for product testing among friends

14. Virtual Dressing Room (future feature)

Live or recorded try-on sessions with friends

Mirrors real-life dressing room experience digitally

Group events for styling decisions or big purchases (paused for now)

💡 Tech Infrastructure Notes for Devs
Backend: User auth, item database, wishlist + closet objects, link parsing logic

Frontend: SwiftUI / React Native for mobile app; extension integration for browser

AI/ML: Use image recognition APIs (e.g. Google Vision, Clarifai) + LLMs for recs

Chrome/Safari Extensions: Use native APIs for scraping product info

Optional integrations: Shopify, Zara, Bloomingdale’s APIs for syncing past purchases
